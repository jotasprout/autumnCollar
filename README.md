# Color Changing Collar

## Purpose

The closer the owner is to their pet, the more dramatic the color change. 

### Zana (all versions)

When Zana is absent or beyond 20 meters, collar is black. When Zana was within 20 meters, a pink bar appeared in the center of the collar. Intended improvement was to increase the width of the bar as she became closer, until the entire collar was pink. 

These changes were not implemented as general consensus was between lag and quick pace of avatar movement, the incremental change would probably not be apparent.

### Charlotte v1

Skeleton code for the incremental changes was completed for v1 and colors are based both on Charlotte's eyes and those which match her favorite colors -- blue and green.
